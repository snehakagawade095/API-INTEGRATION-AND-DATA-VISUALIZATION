📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to integrate a public API using Python and visualize real-time data using popular data visualization libraries. The OpenWeatherMap 5-day weather forecast API is used to fetch weather data for a selected city (Pune). The retrieved data is processed and visualized to analyze temperature and humidity trends over time.

🎯 Objective

Fetch real-time weather forecast data using a public API

Process and organize data using Pandas

Visualize weather trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn

🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used

Python

Requests – for API calls

Pandas – for data manipulation

Matplotlib – for plotting graphs

Seaborn – for enhanced visualization styling

🔄 Workflow

Send an HTTP request to the OpenWeatherMap API using a valid API key and city name.

Receive the weather forecast data in JSON format.

Validate the API response to ensure successful data retrieval.

Extract required parameters such as:

Date & Time

Temperature (°C)

Humidity (%)

Store the extracted data in a Pandas DataFrame.

Create visualizations to display weather trends clearly.

📊 Data Visualization

Two line charts are generated:

Temperature Forecast – shows temperature variation over time

Humidity Forecast – shows humidity changes over the forecast period

Both graphs are plotted side by side with proper titles, axis labels, and rotated x-axis values for better readability.

📈 Results

A structured DataFrame displaying date-time wise temperature and humidity values.

Visual insights into weather patterns over the forecast duration.

Easy comparison of temperature and humidity trends.

✅ Conclusion

This project successfully implements API integration and data visualization using Python. It meets the requirements of CODTECH Internship – Task 1 by demonstrating real-world data fetching, processing, and visualization techniques. The project strengthens practical skills essential for data analysis and software development.
